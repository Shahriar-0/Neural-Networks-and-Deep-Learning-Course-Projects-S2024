    "This notebook is a step-by-step tutorial on how to train a Faster R-CNN model for object detection for underwater images. The dataset used in this notebook is the [Underwater Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/slavkoprytula/aquarium-data-cots). "

    "## Introduction \n",
    "Object detection is a computer vision task that involves both localizing objects in images and classifying them. Faster R-CNN is a popular deep learning model for object detection that is an evolution of the R-CNN and Fast R-CNN models. Faster R-CNN is composed of two modules: a region proposal network (RPN) that generates region proposals and a network that uses these proposals to detect objects. You can learn more about this network [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497). The architecture used in this notebook is based on [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368708716_Underwater_Object_Detection_Method_Based_on_Improved_Faster_RCNN)."

    "In this notebook we will use some techniques to improve the performance of the model, such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning, OHEM, GIOU loss, and Soft-NMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Augmentation**: Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the images. This technique can help the model generalize better to new data and improve its performance.\n",
    "- **Transfer Learning**: Transfer learning is a technique that allows you to use a pre-trained model as a starting point for training a new model on a different task. This can help you achieve better performance with less data and computational resources.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the best set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. This can help you improve the performance of the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "- **OHEM**: Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) is a technique used to focus the training process on the most challenging examples in the dataset. This can help the model learn from its mistakes and improve its performance.\n",
    "- **GIOU Loss**: Generalized Intersection over Union (GIOU) is a loss function used to measure the similarity between two bounding boxes. This loss function can help the model learn to predict more accurate bounding boxes.\n",
    "- **Soft-NMS**: Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft-NMS) is a technique used to suppress overlapping bounding boxes by reducing the confidence scores of nearby boxes. This can help the model produce more accurate detections."
